# TabAd

This project demonstrates a creative approach to using the browser tab as a form of advertisement by dynamically updating the tab's title and favicon. The goal is to attract attention to the website by simulating an advertisement in the tab itself.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tab Title**: The title of the browser tab changes every 2 seconds, cycling through different promotional messages to simulate an ad.
- **Rotating Favicon**: The favicon in the browser tab changes alongside the title, creating a flashing effect that draws attention.
